MediSure Health – Claim Scenarios Guide (2025)
Version: 1.0
Last Updated: November 2025

This document describes the synthetic claim files used in the MediSure Agentic Claims Automation project.
Each scenario is designed to test specific behaviors of the system: extraction, validation, RAG retrieval, authorization logic, fraud detection, and error handling.

1. Overview of Claim Files

The following claim files are present in the repository under data/sample_claims/:

claim_001.json

claim_002.json

claim_003.json

claim_004.json

claim_005.json

claim_006.json

claim_007.xml

claim_008.xml

claim_009.json

claim_010.pdf

The claims intentionally use different formats:

JSON → modern API-style claims

XML → legacy system claims

PDF → uploaded/scan-style claims

These reflect typical real-world inputs handled by healthcare claim engines.

2. Standard Office Visit Scenarios

2.1 claim_001.json – Office Visit + Lab Panel

Format: JSON

Patient: John Carter

Procedures:

99213 – Office Visit

80050 – General Health Panel

Total Amount: $430

Purpose:

Tests extraction of multiple procedures

Validates office visit + lab combination

Exercises policy rules around CPT 99213 and 80050, and frequency limits.

2.2 claim_002.json – Simple Strep Test

Format: JSON

Patient: Sarah Johnson

Procedures:

87880 – Rapid Strep Test

Total Amount: $85

Purpose:

Simple baseline claim

Used as a “happy-path” scenario for automated approval

Validates that low-cost, straightforward claims pass through with minimal checks.

2.3 claim_003.json – ECG Visit

Format: JSON

Patient: Michael Lee

Procedures:

93000 – Electrocardiogram

Total Amount: $120

Purpose:

Basic diagnostic service

Tests extraction and mapping for ECG-related rules

Can be used for future extensions like cardiac risk scenarios.

3. High-Cost Imaging Scenarios

3.1 claim_004.json – CT Head Scan (High Cost)

Format: JSON

Procedure:

70450 – CT Head Scan

Total Amount: $1500

Purpose:

Tests high-cost thresholds

Triggers prior authorization and high-cost review logic

Connects to imaging rules and diagnosis S09.90XA (head injury).

3.2 claim_005.json – MRI Lumbar Spine (Very High Cost)

Format: JSON

Procedure:

72148 – MRI Lumbar Spine

Total Amount: $2300

Purpose:

Exercises high-cost procedure rules

Validates medical necessity criteria for low-back pain

Good candidate for authorization + RAG retrieval demonstration.

3.3 claim_006.json – Abdominal Ultrasound + Lab Panel

Format: JSON

Procedures:

76700 – Abdominal Ultrasound

80050 – General Health Panel

Total Amount: $1190

Purpose:

Multi-procedure, moderate-to-high cost claim

Tests combination of imaging + lab + cost rules

Useful for pipeline paths where some services may be auto-approved and others escalated.

4. XML-Based Legacy Claims

4.1 claim_007.xml – CT Head (XML Claim)

Format: XML

Procedure: 70450 – CT Head Scan

Total Amount: $1200

Purpose:

Represents legacy or external partner claim format

Tests XML parsing, data extraction, and normalization into internal schema

Exercises the same authorization rules as JSON-based CT claims.

4.2 claim_008.xml – MRI Spine (XML Claim)

Format: XML

Procedure: 72148 – MRI Lumbar Spine

Total Amount: $2000

Purpose:

Similar to claim_005.json but using XML

Used to verify consistent handling of rules regardless of input format

Helps validate “format-agnostic” behavior of the extraction agent.

5. Error and Edge-Case Scenarios

5.1 claim_009.json – Missing Fields Claim

Format: JSON

Patient Name: null

Provider ID: empty string

Diagnosis Codes: empty list

Purpose:

Designed to test robustness of validation logic

Confirms that missing critical fields trigger automatic escalation

Useful for testing error reporting and structured error responses.

5.2 claim_010.pdf – Fraud-Like Duplicate Billing

Format: PDF

Procedures (duplicated):

99213 twice

87880 twice

Total Amount: $470

Purpose:

Simulates a classic duplicate billing pattern

Designed to work with FWA rules from the Fraud, Waste & Abuse manual

Tests PDF ingestion, OCR/text extraction, and duplicate-detection logic

Ideal for fraud-scoring agent and SIU/escalation scenario demonstrations.

6. How These Scenarios Are Used in the Agentic Pipeline

Each claim scenario can be routed through different flows in the agentic system:

Standard Claims (001–003)

Test end-to-end “happy path” automation

Validate extraction → RAG → decision

High-Cost Claims (004–006)

Exercise prior authorization logic

Use RAG over authorization_rules_2025.docx

Validate allowed amounts and frequency checks

XML Claims (007–008)

Validate multi-format ingestion

Test the XML normalization stage before agent processing

Error/Missing Fields (009)

Validate defensive programming

Ensures low-quality input doesn’t silently pass through the system

Fraud-Like Claim (010)

Connects directly to fraud_waste_abuse_2025.docx FWA rules

Provides a realistic demo for fraud detection and escalation

7. Future Extensions

This guide can be extended as more synthetic claims are added, such as:

Inpatient hospitalization scenarios

Medication/pharmacy-related claims

Telehealth-heavy claim sets

Chronic condition utilization patterns

Each new scenario should be:
