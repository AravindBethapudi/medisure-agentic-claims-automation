# 🧱 **1.0 INTRODUCTION**

### **1.1 Purpose**

This manual describes MediSure Health’s standards for identifying, preventing, and investigating potential instances of Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA) within the claims submission process.

It sets requirements for:

* Automated detection systems
* Manual investigation procedures
* Provider compliance expectations
* Escalation and reporting

---

### **1.2 Scope**

Applicable to:

* All claims submitted to MediSure Health
* All provider types
* All benefit plans
* All adjudication channels

---

### **1.3 Key Definitions**

**Fraud:**
Intentional deception or misrepresentation to obtain unauthorized benefits.

**Waste:**
Overuse of services or inefficient practices that increase costs.

**Abuse:**
Practices inconsistent with sound medical or financial standards.

---

### **1.4 Regulatory Framework**

This policy aligns with:

* CMS Program Integrity Manual
* HIPAA Fraud & Abuse Standards
* Federal False Claims Act
* State-level Medicaid regulations

---

# 🧱 **2.0 CATEGORIES OF FRAUD, WASTE & ABUSE**

### **2.1 Fraud — Examples**

* Billing for services not rendered
* Submitting altered or falsified documentation
* Upcoding to higher-level CPT codes
* Misrepresenting diagnosis to justify services

---

### **2.2 Waste — Examples**

* Ordering unnecessary tests
* Repeating diagnostic procedures
* Inefficient use of resources

---

### **2.3 Abuse — Examples**

* Billing excessive frequency of services
* Providing services beyond clinical need
* Misuse of CPT modifiers

---

### **2.4 High-Risk Provider Patterns**

Providers may be flagged if they:

* Bill ≥ 300% above peer baseline
* Submit high volume of duplicate claims
* Routinely bill incompatible ICD/CPT combinations
* Frequently exceed frequency limits

---

# 🧱 **3.0 DUPLICATE BILLING & UPCODING GUIDELINES**

### **3.1 Duplicate CPT Detection**

Duplicate CPT codes occurring:

* On the same date
* For the same member
* By the same provider

→ **Flag as possible duplicate claim**

---

### **3.2 Duplicate Day-of-Service Review**

A repeat procedure within:

* 0–1 days → **Likely duplicate**
* 2–30 days → **Requires clinical justification**
* > 30 days → Allowed if medically supported

---

### **3.3 Upcoding Red Flags**

Upcoding indicators include:

* Billing CPT 99214 instead of 99213 without documentation
* Using MRI (72148) instead of X-ray when not indicated

---

### **3.4 Modifier Abuse**

Examples:

* Modifier -25 added without significant service
* Modifier -59 used to bypass bundling rules

---

### **3.5 Billing Patterns Table**

| Pattern               | Description | Risk Level |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| High volume CPT 99213 | >20/day     | Medium     |
| Frequent 70450 scans  | >8/week     | High       |
| Repeated 87880        | >3/day      | Medium     |
| Same CPT twice/day    | Duplicate   | High       |

---

# 🧱 **4.0 HIGH-RISK PROVIDER BEHAVIOR**

### **4.1 Provider Risk Scoring Model**

Scoring Dimensions (0–100 scale):

* Billing volume
* Documentation quality
* ICD/CPT match rate
* Repeat abnormal claims
* Prior audits

Providers scoring ≥ 70 → **High-Risk Tier**

---

### **4.2 High-Volume Billing Patterns**

Examples:

* > 10 imaging tests per day
* > 30 office visits/day
* > 5 high-cost MRIs per week

---

### **4.3 Suspicious Frequency Patterns**

Indicators include:

* Weekly CT scans for same member
* Repeated MRI of same anatomical region

---

### **4.4 Member Overutilization**

Cases include:

* Members receiving >5 major diagnostics per month
* Repeated ER visits for same condition

---

### **4.5 Provider Watchlist Policies**

Providers may be placed on watchlist if:

* ≥3 failed audits within 12 months
* History of billing anomalies
* Peer outlier status

---

# 🧱 **5.0 FWA DETECTION RULES**

### **5.1 Automated Detection Rules**

Rule examples:

* Duplicate CPT detection rule
* Allowed amount threshold rule
* High-Risk provider escalation rule
* ICD/CPT mismatch rule

---

### **5.2 Clinical Inconsistency Checks**

Examples:

* Head injury ICD missing in CT head scan claim
* Back pain ICD missing in MRI spine request

---

### **5.3 ICD/CPT Mismatch Table**

| ICD Code | Expected CPT | Notes               |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| S09.90XA | 70450        | Required for trauma |
| M54.4    | 72148        | Lower back pain     |
| J02.9    | 87880        | Strep test          |

---

### **5.4 Cost-Based Red Flags**

Triggered if:

* Claim amount > 150% of allowed
* Claim includes repeated high-cost procedures

---

### **5.5 Machine-Learning Risk Indicators**

AI-based red flags include:

* Outlier provider behavior
* Statistical anomalies
* Sequential duplicate claim patterns

---

# 🧱 **6.0 DOCUMENTATION & CODING REQUIREMENTS**

### **6.1 Minimum Documentation**

Must include:

* Member name
* Date of service
* Diagnosis
* Procedure performed
* Clinical justification

### **7.1 Automated FWA Triage**

System classifies claim as:

* Low risk
* Medium risk
* High risk
* Critical

---

### **7.2 Case Creation**

* Preliminary risk score

---

### **7.3 Nurse Review**

Nurses evaluate:

* Clinical necessity
* Documentation quality
* Provider history

---

### **7.4 SIU (Special Investigation Unit) Review**

---

### **7.5 Outcomes & Dispositions**

* Approve
* Partial approve
* Deny
* Refer to law enforcement
* Provider audit
* Education letter

---
